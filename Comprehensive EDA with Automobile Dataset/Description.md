## Data Loading and Exploration

The first step is to load the dataset and inspect its initial structure.

### Assigning Column Names

The dataset is loaded without a header, so column names are assigned based on the provided list.

### Initial Data View

The first 10 rows of the dataset are displayed to get a glimpse of the data structure and values.

### Column Data Types

The data types of each column are examined to understand how the data is currently represented.

### Handling Missing Values

The dataset contains missing values represented by '?'. These are replaced with `np.nan` for proper handling, and the count of missing values per column is checked.

## NumPy Basics

Basic NumPy operations are performed to analyze numerical features.

### Analyzing 'engine_size'

The 'engine_size' column is converted to a NumPy array, and its distribution is visualized using a distribution plot.

### Analyzing 'curb_weight'

The maximum and minimum values in the 'curb_weight' column are found, and its distribution is visualized using a box plot.

### Generating Random Matrix

A 2x5 matrix of random integers is generated and visualized using a heatmap as a demonstration of NumPy's capabilities.

## Pandas Operations

Pandas operations are used for data manipulation and aggregation.

### Handling Missing Prices

Rows with missing 'price' values are dropped to ensure accurate price analysis.

### Analyzing 'horsepower'

The mean, median, and standard deviation of the 'horsepower' column are calculated.

### Analyzing 'city_mpg' by 'drive_wheels'

The average 'city_mpg' is calculated by grouping the data by 'drive_wheels'.

## Data Visualization

Various visualizations are created using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore relationships and distributions.

### Number of Cars by 'make'

A bar chart is created to show the count of cars for each manufacturer.

### 'horsepower' vs 'price'

A line chart is plotted to visualize the relationship between 'horsepower' and 'price'.

### 'price' by 'body_style'

A violin plot is used to show the distribution of 'price' for different 'body_style' categories.

## Feature Analysis and Correlation

This section focuses on analyzing relationships between features and creating new ones.

### Correlation between 'engine_size' and 'horsepower'

The correlation coefficient between 'engine_size' and 'horsepower' is calculated, and their relationship is visualized using scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

### Creating and Analyzing 'weight_to_engine_ratio'

A new feature, 'weight_to_engine_ratio', is created by dividing 'curb_weight' by 'engine_size'. Its distribution is analyzed using a histogram, and descriptive statistics are provided.

### Relationship between 'drive_wheels' and 'price'](#relationship-between-drive_wheels-and-price)

A box plot is used to visualize the relationship between 'drive_wheels' and 'price', showing how price varies across different drive types.

## Outcomes of the EDA Analysis

The notebook concludes with a summary of the key findings from the EDA, including:

- Observed correlations between numerical features.
- Price variations based on categorical features like drive wheels and body style.
- Insights into the distributions of various features.
- Identification of potential outliers.
- The impact of data cleaning and feature engineering on the analysis.
